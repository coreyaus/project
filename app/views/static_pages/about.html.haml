				This is the start of a classy little eCommerce site built with the purpose of learning
				%a{:href => 'http://rubyonrails.org/'} Ruby on Rails
				and feeding my addiction to programming.
			%p
				Stay tuned - I'm very much looking forward to (finally) making this happen!
			%p
				This site is based on 
				%a{:href => 'http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/'}Grayscale
				\. It uses photos by
				%a{:href => 'https://unsplash.com/'}UnSplash
				, and a custom Google Maps skin taken from
